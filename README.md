# Craft Priority
Prevents eating, when trying to mass fill casks, kegs, etc.
Only makes sense to use, if the main button (tool button) does not work in some cases.

It allows you to...
 - **Hold** the action button when filling machines
 - Not have to deal with an **annoying message**, asking if you want to eating
 - **Efficiently** finish your farm work

Enjoy.
