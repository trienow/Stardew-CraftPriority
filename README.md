# Craft Priority
Prevents eating, when trying to mass fill casks, kegs, etc.

It allows you to...
 - **Hold** the action button when filling machines
 - Not have to deal with an **annoying message**, asking if you want to eating
 - **Efficiently** finish your farm work

Enjoy.

Requires the awesome [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)! 
See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/trienow/Stardew-CraftPriority/wiki) for more details.
